# Challenge  02: Deploy and Utilize NVIDIA Riva ASR on Azure

### Estimated Time: 45 Minutes

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will deploy and utilize NVIDIA Riva ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) on an Azure GPU-enabled virtual machine. You will generate the necessary NVIDIA API keys, create and configure a GPU-enabled virtual machine in Azure, set up and run the NVIDIA Riva ASR container, and configure network security group rules for external access. This challenge aims to provide hands-on experience deploying AI models and using cloud resources to create AI-ready applications.

Riva ASR NIM APIs provide easy access to state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for multiple languages. Riva ASR NIM models are built on the NVIDIA software platform, incorporating CUDA, TensorRT, and Triton to offer out-of-the-box GPU acceleration.

Riva ASR supports mono, 16-bit audio in WAV, OPUS, and FLAC formats. If you do not have a speech file, use a sample speech file embedded in the Docker container launched in the previous section.

> **Note**: This challenge must be completed successfully as it is a prerequisite for Challenge 6. Ensure that all tasks and steps outlined in this challenge are executed properly and that the desired outcomes are achieved before proceeding to Challenge 6.

### Task 1: Generate NGC API KEY

> **Note:** This process of getting the NGC API key is no longer recommended. The participant is recommended to get the API key through build.nvidia.com as mentioned on the Scenario page.

The NVIDIA API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests to NVIDIA's APIs, such as the NGC (NVIDIA GPU Cloud) services. This key allows developers to access various resources, including pre-trained models, GPU-accelerated software, and container images. Obtaining an API key typically involves creating an account on NVIDIA's developer portal and generating the key within the account settings. It is important to keep this key secure, as it grants access to your NVIDIA resources and can be used for billing purposes.

   ```

   ![](../media/download-deploy-run.png)

   > **Note**: Please use the NGC keys provided below.
  
     ```
     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
     ```

   > **Note**: Setting up the NVIDIA Riva model within the Docker Desktop environment can be a time-consuming process. Depending on factors such as network speed and system performance, the setup procedure may take as long as one hour to complete. Please be patient and allow sufficient time for the installation and configuration to finish. Minimize the tab and proceed with the next challenge while monitoring the configuration every 20 minutes.

6. Once the NVIDIA Riva model has succeeded, start the new CMD session and connect it to the VM through SSH.
