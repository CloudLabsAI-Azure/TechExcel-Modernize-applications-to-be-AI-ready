# Challenge 02: Deploy and Utilize NVIDIA Riva ASR on Azure

### Estimated Time: 45 Minutes

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will deploy and utilize NVIDIA Riva ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) on an Azure GPU-enabled virtual machine. You will generate the necessary NVIDIA API keys, create and configure a GPU-enabled virtual machine in Azure, set up and run the NVIDIA Riva ASR container, and configure network security group rules for external access. This challenge aims to provide hands-on experience deploying AI models and using cloud resources to create AI-ready applications.

Riva ASR NIM APIs provide easy access to state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for multiple languages. Riva ASR NIM models are built on the NVIDIA software platform, incorporating CUDA, TensorRT, and Triton to offer out-of-the-box GPU acceleration.

Riva ASR supports mono, 16-bit audio in WAV, OPUS, and FLAC formats. If you do not have a speech file, use a sample speech file embedded in the Docker container launched in the previous section.

## Prerequisites

- **NVIDIA AI Enterprise License**: Riva ASR NIM is available for self-hosting under the NVIDIA AI Enterprise (NVAIE) License.
- **NVIDIA GPU(s)**: Riva ASR NIM runs on any NVIDIA GPU with sufficient GPU memory (e.g., Standard NC4as_T4_v3).

2. **Create and Connect to a GPU-Enabled Virtual Machine in Azure**

   - **Create a GPU Virtual Machine**: Select **NVIDIA GPU-Optimized VMI with vGPU driver - v22.08.0 - x64 Gen 2** as the image and choose **NC4as_T4_v3** as the VM size in **Eastus** region.

   - **Configure Storage**: Set **OS disk size** to **128 GB,** select **Standard SSD (locally redundant storage)** as the OS disk type and create.

   - **Connect to the VM**: Connected to the GPU Virtual Machine using SSH.

3. **Set Up and Run NVIDIA Riva ASR Container**

   - Set up the NVIDIA Container Toolkit by adding your user to the docker group:
      
      ```bash
      sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
      
      # Apply changes (logout/login required)
      newgrp docker
      ```

   - Configure your NGC API Key:

      ```bash
      # Set your NGC API Key (replace with your actual key)
      export NGC_API_KEY="your-ngc-api-key"

      # Add to shell configuration for persistence
      echo "export NGC_API_KEY=your-ngc-api-key" >> ~/.bashrc

      # Log in to NGC container registry
      echo "$NGC_API_KEY" | docker login nvcr.io --username '$oauthtoken' --password-stdin
      ```

   - Run the NVIDIA Riva ASR Container:
      
      ```bash
      # Set model selector
      export NIM_TAGS_SELECTOR="name=parakeet-1-1b-ctc-riva-en-us,mode=all"

      # Run the container
      docker run -it --rm --name=riva-asr \
         --gpus '"device=0"' \
         --shm-size=8GB \
         -e NGC_API_KEY \
         -e NIM_HTTP_API_PORT=9000 \
         -e NIM_GRPC_API_PORT=50051 \
         -p 9000:9000 \
         -p 50051:50051 \
         -e NIM_TAGS_SELECTOR \
         nvcr.io/nim/nvidia/riva-asr:1.3.0
      ```

     > **Note**: Setting up the NVIDIA Riva model within the Docker Desktop environment can be a time-consuming process. Depending on factors such as network speed and system performance, the setup procedure may take as long as one hour to complete. Please be patient and allow sufficient time for the installation and configuration to finish. Minimize the tab and proceed with the next challenge while monitoring the configuration every 20 minutes.

   - Once the NVIDIA Riva ASR deployment has succeeded, open a new terminal, connect to the VM, and run the following command to check if the service can handle inference requests.

     ```
     curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:9000/v1/health/ready'
     ```

   - If the service is ready, you will get a response similar to the following:

     ```
     {"status":"ready"}
     ```

## Success Criteria

- Successfully generate the NGC API key through the NVIDIA build platform.
- Create and connect to a GPU-enabled virtual machine in Azure.
- Set up and run the NVIDIA Riva ASR container within the virtual machine.
